            Question answering systems is a wide and active area, with much scope of further
            research. In our Research we look into the semantics of the web search (Google and
            Wikipedia resource) to answer the questions, asked from the user. The principal
            algorithm used is WEB SEARCH to find the sentences, in which the topic is similar to the
            query. Then we use cosine similarity algorithm to rank the answers.</p>
        <h2>What is a Open domain question answering System ?</h2>
        <p>In order for the computers to interact with the users more naturally,the
            computer must understand and infer what the user wants to say from what he
            actually says(the latent meaning). Question Answering System (referred to
            QAS henceforth) is basically a search program that strives to give the best
            possible answers to the questions asked. In information retrieval, an open
            domain question answering system aims at returning an answer in response to
            the user's question. The returned answer is in the form of short texts rather
            than a list of relevant documents. The system uses a combination of techniques
            from computational linguistics, information retrieval and knowledge representation
            for finding answers.There is a two-fold complexity of the question which must be considered,
            before answering a question:

        <ul>
            <li>Acquire userâ€™s true intentions from question</li>
            <li>The answer should be complete in best possible way and at same time
                non-redundant
            </li>
        </ul>
        We use Wikipedia and Google search resource as the web knowledge base as this specific knowledge
        database usually contains the entire information needed to answer a complex
        question.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>Their can be many types of Question Answering system. But, in our project, we have focused on descriptive
            question answering, where the system gives the most probable sentence as the answer, to the question asked,
            from its KB. To get the implementational details of the project have a look on the report, that describes it's deepest
            quirk.
